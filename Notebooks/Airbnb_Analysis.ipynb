We noticed that there appear to be a few listings that were entered incorrectly.  For example, when looking at box plots of the data, we see that at least one listing has 30 bedrooms.  Plotting bedrooms versus accomodates shows that those listings accommodate less than 5 people, which doesn't make sense.  This is likely a data entry error from someone renting an apartment or hotel with 30 different units which each accommodate 4-5 guests.  The team decided to correct the data and change the number of bedrooms for these listings to 1 bedroom."

To correct the errors, we will change any listings with 0 bedrooms that accommodate more than 4 guests to 2 bedroom listings and any that accommodate less than 5 guests to 1 bedroom listings.
